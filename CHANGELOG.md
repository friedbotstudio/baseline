## [0.2.1](https://github.com/friedbotstudio/baseline/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1) (2026-05-14)


### Bug Fixes

* **release:** release refactors and constitution scope changes ([149e415](https://github.com/friedbotstudio/baseline/commit/149e4157c4da749c9cfba5b96374a81ab24343a0))


### Features

* **site:** wire Google Analytics 4 into the Friedbot Studio site ([14f06f6](https://github.com/friedbotstudio/baseline/commit/14f06f6ad7acc38ccc3674899e13d9519e9b12f0))

# [0.2.0](https://github.com/friedbotstudio/baseline/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0) (2026-05-14)


### Bug Fixes

* **cli:** exclude manifest.json from install copy + make .npmrc opt-in ([ae351e2](https://github.com/friedbotstudio/baseline/commit/ae351e2d56702218588b294eb028f0abbef02970))
* **release:** revert branches range modifier (semantic-release ERELEASEBRANCHES) ([06f79a4](https://github.com/friedbotstudio/baseline/commit/06f79a4ba523c787250364055e4a44572a5f4b2d))


### chore

* **release:** cap main at 0.x + breaking → minor (alpha safety belt) ([0682a28](https://github.com/friedbotstudio/baseline/commit/0682a2838df68e7690f776bf8d1a03b0ba2aaec4))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **release:** / feat! commits from default major to minor so they
actually cut a release within 0.x (0.N → 0.N+1) instead of being silently
skipped by the cap.

Net effect during alpha: feat → minor; fix → patch; feat! / BREAKING
CHANGE → minor (the 0.x semver convention); chore(release / site / ci /
actions) and build → no release (existing rules). When ready for 1.0,
remove both modifications in one chore.

The corresponding release-workflow test (test_when_releaserc_parsed_then_branches_is_main_capped_at_0x_and_next_prerelease,
renamed from the plain-main predecessor) was updated to assert the new
branches shape.
