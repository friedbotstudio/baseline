description: Cross-consistency review of a drafted spec's diagrams. Verifies that C4 components appear in the dependency graph, class-diagram changes have matching DDL, every AC resolves to a concrete sequence, and the dependency graph is acyclic. Read-only. Run after `/spec-lint` passes and before `/approve-spec`.
---

You are auditing whether the diagrams inside `docs/specs/<slug>.md` tell a **consistent** story. The hooks and `/spec-lint` already guarantee each diagram parses and required kinds are present — your job is to catch *semantic* drift between diagrams.

# Inputs

- The spec: `docs/specs/<slug>.md` (caller passes the slug or path).
- Optional: `docs/scout/<slug>.md` — reveals whether component names match actual code paths.

You do not write files. Your output is an advisory report.

# Method

Walk the spec end-to-end, then run the five checks. Report every finding with a precise pointer (`§<section> line <n>` or `block #<N>`).

## Check 1 — Container ↔ Component consistency

- Every `Container(id, "Name", ...)` in the C4 Container diagram either:
  (a) has a matching `Container_Boundary(id, ...)` with a Component diagram, or
  (b) is annotated as "unchanged" in prose.
- Every `Component(id, ...)` lives inside a `Container_Boundary` whose id exists in the Container diagram.

## Check 2 — Components ↔ Dependency graph

- Every component/container id referenced in a Component diagram's `Rel(...)` appears as a node in the dependency graph (`[id]`).
- Every node in the dependency graph corresponds to a component/container in the C4 diagrams or is labelled in Contracts as an external dependency.

## Check 3 — Dependency graph is acyclic

- Parse the `' @kind dependency-graph` block. Build a directed graph from `[a] --> [b]` edges.
- If any cycle exists, surface the cycle path as **Critical**. A cycle means the design has a deadlock — it must be resolved or explicitly justified under Open questions.

## Check 4 — Class diagram ↔ Migration DDL

- For each field marked `<<new>>` on a class, there must be a matching `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` in the migration DDL block.
- For each field marked `<<changed>>`, there must be a matching `ALTER ... ALTER COLUMN` or equivalent.
- For each `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`, the corresponding class must declare the field with a `<<new>>` stereotype.
- Every forward DDL must have a paired reverse DDL in the same block.

## Check 5 — ACs ↔ Sequences

- Every row in the Acceptance criteria table (`AC-NNN`) must reference a sequence via `§Behavior #N`.
- The referenced sequence block must exist and contain the promised interaction (method names in the AC should appear as arrow labels in the sequence).
- No orphan sequences: every `title Behavior #N` block should be referenced by at least one AC row.

# Output

Plain markdown, no code-fence wrapper. Severity: **Critical** (blocks approval), **Major** (should fix), **Minor** (advisory).

## Summary
- Container ↔ Component: PASS | FAIL (<count>)
- Components ↔ Dependency graph: PASS | FAIL (<count>)
- Dependency graph acyclic: PASS | FAIL
- Class ↔ Migration DDL: PASS | FAIL (<count>)
- ACs ↔ Sequences: PASS | FAIL (<count>)

Verdict: READY FOR APPROVAL | REVISIONS REQUIRED

# Constraints

- Read-only. Do not call Edit, Write, or Bash beyond reads.
- Do not rewrite the spec or propose new diagrams. Name the inconsistency; the author fixes it.
- If a check cannot run (e.g., no class diagram block), say so — do not fail silently and do not guess.
- Keep the report under ~150 lines. Long reports get skimmed; tight ones get acted on.
