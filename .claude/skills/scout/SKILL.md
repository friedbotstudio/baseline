description: Workflow Phase 2 — Codebase Scouting and Constraint Discovery. Maps the relevant slice of the codebase for a given task. Produces a scout report at `docs/scout/<slug>.md` naming the files, modules, and patterns the proposed work touches or constrains. Report decisions execute in main context with full conversation visibility; gathering MAY be delegated to read-only advisory subagents (seed.md §4.2-A).
argument-hint: "[optional: specific path to scope the scout]"

You are mapping the slice of the codebase that matters for the current task — no more, no less. The scout report is consumed downstream by `/research` and `/spec`.

# Prereqs

- `.claude/state/workflow.json` exists.
- `intake` is in `completed` OR in `exceptions`. If neither, stop and direct the user to invoke `intake`.

# Inputs

- The intake document at `docs/intake/<slug>.md` — read **Problem** and **Goal** first; they define scope.
- The BRD at `docs/brd/<slug>.md` if present — In/Out scope lists.
- The codebase at the project root.
- Optional argument: a specific path to scope the scout.

If no intake exists (ad-hoc invocation), fall back to the parent task description and note in the report that the scout ran without a structured intake.

# Method

0. **Reconcile against the workspace corpus before discovering anything.** This step
   is gated — check the flag FIRST:

   ```
   node -e "import('./.claude/skills/workspace/flags.mjs').then(m=>console.log(m.workspaceEnabled({rootDir:process.cwd()})))"
   ```

   `false` (the default, and the value for any project that has not opted in) → skip
   the rest of this step entirely and go to step 1. A populated corpus must not
   change scout's behaviour for a project that never asked for it.

   `true` → if `docs/system/elements/` holds any element, this scout run
   is a **reconciliation**, not a rediscovery:

   ```
   node -e "import('./.claude/skills/workspace/reconcile.mjs').then(m=>console.log(JSON.stringify(m.reconcile({specDir:'docs/system', touchedPaths:process.argv.slice(1)}))))" <touched paths>
   ```

   `mode: "reconcile"` → report the returned `delta` (`changed` /
   `unreferenced`) for the slice being touched and go straight to step 3; the
   corpus already answers "what is this system". `mode: "discovery"` → the corpus
   is absent or empty, so fall through to step 1 and scout normally.

   The delta carries exactly those two keys. `added` and `stale` are deliberately
   absent from `reconcile.mjs`: `added` would need a prior reconcile snapshot that
   does not exist, and staleness is decided per element by `classify`, which
   `/memory-flush` Step 0e surfaces. Reporting a field the helper never returns is
   how a scout report comes to describe a delta nobody computed.

   This step is the whole point of the corpus: without it the modules are an
   orphan nothing calls, and every cycle pays full rediscovery again. A delta that
   names every element is a re-derivation — report that as a corpus defect rather
   than passing it off as a delta.

0.5 **Resolve the tracking annotations the code carries.** Gated the same way —
   check the flag FIRST:

   ```
   node -e "import('./.claude/skills/workspace/flags.mjs').then(m=>console.log(m.annotationsEnabled({rootDir:process.cwd()})))"
   ```

   `false` (the default) → skip the rest of this step and go to step 1. `true` →
   scan and resolve:

   ```
   node -e "import('./.claude/skills/workspace/annotations.mjs').then(m=>console.log(JSON.stringify(m.scanAnnotations({rootDir:process.cwd(), memDir:'.claude/memory'}),null,1)))"
   ```

   Report both halves of the result in the scout report's **Constraints** section:

   - `resolved[]` → for every annotation whose governed file is in the slice being
     touched, surface `file:line` plus the entry's `hook` line. This is the reason
     the code has its shape, reaching the person about to change it — the whole
     point of the annotation.
   - `dangling[]` → report EVERY entry, in or out of the slice. An annotation
     naming a deleted or renamed entry asserts that a reason exists and then sends
     the reader nowhere; it is the one case worth being loud about, and silence
     lets it rot indefinitely.

   The scan reports; it never blocks. A dangling annotation is a finding for the
   report, not a failed phase.

1. **Identify the nouns and verbs in the task.** Each is a search anchor.
2. **For each anchor, pick the right tool:**
   - **Structural / navigation questions** ("where does the data on page X come from?", "what component renders Y?", "what wraps Z?", "find the API for this icon/button"): invoke `Skill(code-browser)`. It walks the import graph from the page down to the network boundary and returns flat indexes (`byHook` / `byService` / `byApiCall` / `byComponent`) — far more reliable than keyword grep, which routinely picks up unrelated flows that share a domain word.
   - **Direct concept-to-file lookups** (a named feature plus a file kind: `reducer`, `types`, `hook`, `context`, `service`): consult `code-browser`'s `conventions.md` if present, or `Glob` against the convention path — no walker needed.
   - **Term sweeps** ("every file that references flag F", "all callers of util U", config / migration / deploy-manifest searches): `rg` (or `grep -r`) for the exact term, filtered to source directories. Read the top 3–5 hits with surrounding context. Follow imports/callers one hop out — do not recurse further.

   If a navigation question lands you in `rg` first, stop and switch to `code-browser` — that is the failure mode the skill exists to prevent.

   **Gathering delegation (seed.md §4.2-A).** A broad sweep MAY be delegated to a read-only advisory subagent (e.g. `Explore`): it returns findings only — no writes, no decisions. What enters the report is decided here, in main context.
3. **Identify entry points** — HTTP routes, CLI commands, cron jobs, queue consumers — that would trigger the code path being modified.
4. **Identify existing tests** for the affected code. Note flaky/skipped ones.
5. **Note constraints** — config files, feature flags, migrations, deploy manifests that need lockstep changes.

# Output

Write the report to `docs/scout/<slug>.md` (create the directory if missing). Format:

```
# Codebase Scout Report — <task>

## Primary touchpoints
- <path:line> — <role in the task>
- ...

## Entry points that reach this code
- <HTTP route / CLI cmd / job> at <path:line>

## Existing tests
- <test path> — <what it covers> — <passing? skipped?>

## Constraints and co-changes
- <config / migration / flag> — <why it's linked>

## Patterns in use here
- <1–3 sentences on the style the code follows, for the implementer>

## Risks / landmines
- <anything surprising: dead code, TODO comments, shims, version skew>
```

After writing the file, append `"scout"` to `workflow.json → completed`.

Tell the user: `Scout report at <path>. Next: /research.`

# Constraints

- **Project source is read-only during scout.** Do not modify project files. The only write is to `docs/scout/<slug>.md`.
- **Do not speculate.** If a search turns up nothing, say so. Do not invent paths.
- **Keep the report under ~300 lines.** If the surface is genuinely larger, say so and propose a scoping split with the user.
- **Do not recommend an implementation approach.** That is `/research`'s job. Stick to what is.
- **No code generation.** No new files outside `docs/scout/`.
