name: audit-baseline
owner: baseline
description: Drift check between the baseline implementation on disk and the claims in `docs/init/seed.md` + cross-references in CLAUDE.md, README.md, and the rendered docs site. Verifies hook/agent/skill/command names + counts, settings.json wiring, project.json key presence, .mcp.json servers, vendored license files, and helper script presence. Exit 0 PASS / 1 FAIL — suitable for CI. Read-only; safe to invoke any time.

# audit-baseline — drift defender

Mechanical check that the baseline implementation matches its specification. Deterministic, not LLM judgment — pattern matches and file presence only. Run on demand, by `/init-project` Step 8, or in CI.

## What it checks

| Category | Check |
|---|---|
| **Counts** | Hooks, agents, skills, commands on disk match the count claimed in `seed.md` |
| **Names** | Each component's name matches the canonical list in `seed.md` §4 |
| **Helper scripts** | `validate.sh`, `swarm_merge.sh`, `render.sh`, `lint.sh`, `archive.sh` present + executable |
| **settings.json** | Every baseline hook is wired in the correct event/matcher block |
| **project.json** | Every key listed in `seed.md` §13 Step 8 exists (values may be null pre-init) |
| **.mcp.json** | `context7` and `plantuml` servers declared |
| **Vendored licenses** | `claude-automation-recommender/{LICENSE,NOTICE}` present (Apache 2.0 attribution) |
| **Cross-doc counts** | Numeric claims in `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/init/seed.md` match disk |

## Invocation

`/audit-baseline` — model-invocable and user-invocable.

Calls `audit.sh`. Output is a compact pass/fail table with a final verdict. Exits `0` on a clean audit, `1` on any failure. WARN-level findings (advisory; e.g., a doc with no relevant claims) don't fail the audit.

## When to run

- **End of `/init-project`** — Step 8. A fresh baseline should pass.
- **Before `/approve-spec`** — confirm the baseline hasn't drifted.
- **In CI** — fail the build on drift.
- **On demand** — when something feels off, when adding a component, or after a long gap in baseline maintenance.

## When the audit reports drift

- **Counts mismatch** → add the missing component or update `seed.md` to match the new count. Don't update one without the other.
- **Name mismatch** → a component was renamed, added, or removed. Update the canonical lists in `seed.md` §4 and the expected sets in `audit.sh`.
- **Helper missing or non-executable** → `chmod +x` or restore from history.
- **Hook unwired** → add the entry to `.claude/settings.json`.
- **project.json key missing** → re-run `/init-project`, or add the key manually.
- **License missing** (vendored skills) → restore from upstream; this is a license-compliance gap.
- **Cross-doc stale numbers** → update the docs. `seed.md` is the source of truth.

## Maintenance

Expected name sets live in `audit.sh` (see the `expected_*` blocks). Adding a new hook, agent, skill, or command means updating both `audit.sh` and `seed.md`. The audit catches the drift; fix the implementation, not the audit.
