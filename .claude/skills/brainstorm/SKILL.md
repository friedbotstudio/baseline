# brainstorm — PM-mode requirement capture

You are running a Socratic dialogue with the engineer to surface the underlying need behind a request before any solution shape is committed. This skill is invoked at Step 0.5 of `/intake`, `/spec`, and `/tdd` entry skills. Decisions live in main context (Article II); no subagent delegation.

The protocol is **4 specialized stages** (`Skill(research)` recommendation; documented in `docs/research/brainstorm-and-codesign.md` Candidate B). Stage names diverge from design-ui's 5-stage skeleton because brainstorm has no recipe to translate — Stage 2 is multi-turn probing, not a recipe lookup.

## Inputs the caller must provide

```jsonc
{
  "request":        "<the engineer's natural-language request>",
  "slug":           "<kebab-case workflow slug>",
  "calling_phase":  "intake" | "spec" | "tdd"
}
```

## Stage 0 — Skip check

Read `.claude/state/workflow.json`. Use `workflow-defaults.mjs → withDefaults` to apply read-time defaults so legacy workflows missing `skip_brainstorm` are handled correctly (default false).

- `skip_brainstorm === true` (explicit opt-out via `/triage --no-brainstorm` or manual edit) → return `{ final_state: "skipped", brief_path: null }` immediately. No AskUserQuestion fires.
- A `docs/brief/<slug>.md` already exists on disk (idempotency short-circuit per AC-001 concurrency) → return `{ final_state: "complete", brief_path: <existing> }`. Re-running `/intake` on a slug whose brief is already on disk does NOT re-run the dialogue.

Helpers: `skip-check.mjs → shouldSkip(workflowJson)` and `shouldSkipForExistingBrief({slug, rootDir})`.

Validate inputs via `validate-call.mjs → validateCall({request, slug, calling_phase})`. On invalid (empty request, unknown calling_phase, missing slug) → return `{ final_state: "needs_human", brief_path: null, reason: <reason> }`.

## Stage 1 — Gap analysis

Read the raw request. Identify which of the six canonical fields are missing or ambiguous:

| Field | What you're after |
|---|---|
| `actor` | Concrete role/person (not "users") |
| `trigger` | When the problem manifests |
| `current_state` | Observed behavior today (not inferred) |
| `desired_state` | What would happen instead |
| `non_goals` | What's explicitly NOT being changed |
| `solution_leakage` | Solution-shaped verbs in the request (`add X`, `make it`, `improve`, `optimize`, `refactor to`, `use Y`) |

For each detected solution-leakage instance, the gap is "probe the underlying need" — ask what the proposed solution would let the engineer accomplish, not how to implement it.

The gap list is the input to Stage 2.

## Stage 2 — Probe dialogue

Iterate over gaps via `probe-loop.mjs → runProbeLoop({gaps, askFn})`. Cap at 5 iterations. Each iteration:

1. Draft a probe text for the current gap.
2. Run `discipline.mjs → scanTurn(text)` on the probe BEFORE emitting. If `violations.length > 0`, rewrite — never emit a probe containing solution-shaped tokens. The discipline scanner catches solution verbs (`implement`, `refactor`, `add X`), library names (Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.), and solution-proposal phrasing (`we could`, `what if we`, `i recommend`).
3. Emit the probe via `AskUserQuestion`. Capture the answer.
4. If the answer closes the gap, advance. Otherwise re-queue the gap for the next iteration (up to the cap).

After the loop exits (gaps closed OR cap reached), unclosed gaps become `open_questions` in the brief.

**Stage 2 discipline is non-negotiable.** You SHALL NOT propose a solution in any Stage 2 turn. If the engineer proposes one, capture it under `solution_leakage` but keep probing the underlying need.

## Stage 3 — Synthesize, confirm, persist

Synthesize the brief in memory. Present it back to the engineer via `AskUserQuestion`:

- `Yes, capture it` — proceed to write.
- `Edit specific section` — ask which section, return to Stage 2 for that field only.
- `Restart — got it wrong` — full Stage 2 loop again.

Iteration cap: 5 confirm-cycles. After the 5th rejection → return `{ final_state: "needs_human" }`.

On Yes, write the brief via `brief-writer.mjs → writeBrief({outPath, slug, fields})`. The output goes to `docs/brief/<slug>.md` with the six fields in stable order.

Return `{ final_state: "complete", brief_path }`.

## What you write

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `docs/brief/<slug>.md` | The structured brief artifact. Picked up by the calling entry skill as input. |

The state file at `.claude/state/brainstorm/<slug>.json` is OPTIONAL scratch state for resuming mid-dialogue across sessions. Not archived — only the brief survives.

**Forbidden writes**:
- `docs/specs/**` — spec_approval_guard blocks; specs are written by `/spec`.
- Product code — this skill never writes code, only the brief.
- `.claude/state/workflow.json` — the entry skill, not brainstorm, manages workflow state.

## Where you plug into the workflow

- **`/intake` Step 0.5** — invoked when `workflow.json → skip_brainstorm` is false (default).
- **`/spec` Step 0.5** — same gate, when `/spec` is the workflow entry phase (spec-entry track).
- **`/tdd` Step 0.5** — same gate, when `/tdd` is the workflow entry phase (tdd-quickfix track).

The brainstorm gate skill SHALL NOT fire on `chore` or `freeform` tracks (those have no `/intake`/`/spec`/`/tdd` entry seam by design).

## Constraints

- **Never propose a solution during Stage 2.** The `discipline.mjs` scanner is the structural enforcement.
- **Never write outside `docs/brief/<slug>.md`.** Other outputs are the entry skill's territory.
- **Honor the iteration cap (5 in Stage 2, 5 in Stage 3).** Cap exhaustion → `final_state: "needs_human"`.
- **Honor `skip_brainstorm: true` immediately.** No AskUserQuestion fires when the gate skips.
- **Honor existing brief.** Re-invocation reads the existing brief; no re-dialogue.
