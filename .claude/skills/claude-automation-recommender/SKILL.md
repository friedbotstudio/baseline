# Claude Automation Recommender

Analyze codebase patterns to recommend tailored Claude Code automations across all extensibility options.

**This skill is read-only.** It analyzes the codebase and outputs recommendations. It does NOT create or modify any files. Users implement the recommendations themselves or ask Claude separately to help build them.

## Working with the baseline

> **This skill is invoked from inside a project that ships the Claude Code Baseline (`docs/init/seed.md`).** Read that file before recommending — it lists what is already installed.

The baseline already provides the following. **Do not recommend any of these as additions** — they exist:

- **22 hooks**: 17 write/run-boundary guards — `setup_guard`, `destructive_cmd_guard`, `git_commit_guard`, `env_guard`, `spec_approval_guard`, `swarm_approval_guard`, `verify_pass_guard`, `track_guard`, `artifact_template_guard`, `plantuml_syntax_guard`, `spec_diagram_presence_guard`, `spec_design_calls_guard`, `swarm_boundary_guard`, `tdd_order_guard`, `process_lifecycle_guard`, `lint_runner`, `test_runner` — plus 4 lifecycle hooks: `memory_session_start`, `memory_stop`, `memory_pre_compact`, `harness_continuation` — plus 1 input-boundary hook: `consent_gate_grant`.
- **1 subagent**: `swarm-worker` — the only subagent in the baseline. It executes pre-decided recipes from main context inside isolated git worktrees during `/swarm-dispatch`. **No new subagents should be recommended.** All decision-making lives in skills running in main context, where conversational nuance and full file visibility are preserved.
- **36 skills**: artifact drafting (4), workflow phases (10), phase workers — `scenario`, `implement`, `verify`, `prose`, `design-ui` (5), spec helpers — `spec-lint`, `spec-render`, `spec-diagram-review`, `spec-traceability-review` (4), orchestration — `harness`, `swarm-plan`, `swarm-dispatch` (3), memory — `memory-flush` (1), audit — `audit-baseline` (1), alternate tracks — `chore` (1), plus seven shared globals: `claude-automation-recommender`, `code-structure`, `humanizer`, `documentation`, `technical-tutorials`, `copywriting`, `impeccable`. Several skills mandatorily invoke another skill: `scenario` and `implement` invoke `code-structure`; `design-ui` invokes `impeccable`; `prose` invokes `humanizer` (always) and `copywriting` (when persuasive). The `technical-tutorials` skill carries its audience-context reference doc inline at `.claude/skills/technical-tutorials/references/audience-context.md` (consolidated 2026-04-28 from the upstream `developer-audience-context` skill).
- **4 commands**: `/approve-spec`, `/approve-swarm`, `/grant-commit`, `/init-project`.
- **3 MCP servers**: `context7` (library docs), `plantuml` (diagram rendering), `playwright` (Microsoft-official browser automation; used by `design-ui` for cross-engine visual verification, by `integrate` for optional cross-engine smoke).

Your job is to surface **gaps** the baseline doesn't cover for *this project*. Examples of valuable recommendations:

- **Project-management MCPs** (Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues) when the codebase shows references to those systems.
- **Monitoring / observability MCPs** (Sentry, Datadog) when the project has an error-tracking integration.
- **Stack-specific lint/test commands** populating `project.json → test.cmd` and `lint.cmd` based on detected framework (Vitest vs Jest vs pytest, Ruff vs Black vs Prettier+ESLint, etc.).
- **Stack-specific destructive-command patterns** to extend `project.json → destructive.{hard_block,ask}_patterns` (e.g., `terraform destroy`, `kubectl delete`, `rails db:drop`).
- **TDD glob conventions** matching the project's actual test file layout (`*_test.go`, `*.test.tsx`, `tests/test_*.py`).
- **New skills** for repeated project workflows the baseline phases don't cover (e.g., `release-notes` for a project with monthly cuts, or stack-specific skills like `react-patterns` that the `swarm-worker` template can preload via the `{{SKILLS}}` token).

## Output format for `/init-project` consumption

When invoked from `/init-project`, structure your output as a JSON block (in addition to the human-readable narrative) that the orchestrator can parse and apply:

```json
{
  "stack": {
    "language": "typescript",
    "framework": "next.js",
    "test_runner": "vitest",
    "test_cmd": "vitest run --reporter=dot",
    "test_kind": "behavior",
    "linter": "biome",
    "lint_cmd": "biome check --apply"
  },
  "project_json": {
    "test": {
      "kind": "behavior"
    },
    "tdd": {
      "source_globs": ["src/**", "app/**"],
      "test_globs": ["**/*.test.{ts,tsx}"]
    },
    "destructive": {
      "ask_patterns_extend": ["\\bvercel\\s+remove\\b", "\\bsupabase\\s+db\\s+reset\\b"]
    }
  },
  "additions": {
    "mcp_servers": [
      {"name": "linear", "command": "npx -y @linear/mcp", "why": "issues referenced in 23 commits"}
    ],
    "skills": [],
    "hooks": [],
    "swarm_worker_skills": []
  },
  "gaps": [
    "No CI configuration detected; the baseline assumes the user runs tests locally"
  ]
}
```

Set `project_json.test.kind` (mirrored as the stack `test_kind` hint) to tell the chore track whether `test.cmd` can exercise a docs-only change: `behavior` — a code-only suite such as vitest — lets a pure-docs chore skip `verify`; `structural` (or an absent key) — a whole-repo check — always runs it. Recommend `behavior` whenever the `test_cmd` is a unit/integration runner. For vitest specifically, recommend `--reporter=dot` (the `basic` reporter was removed in vitest v4).

When invoked outside `/init-project` (ad-hoc), the human-readable narrative alone is fine — skip the JSON.

### `swarm-worker` template — stack skills the worker should preload

The baseline ships exactly one subagent: `swarm-worker`. It is template-rendered. `/init-project` reads `src/agents/swarm-worker.template.md` and substitutes four tokens. The base body always preloads `scenario` and `implement`; this section is about **adding stack-specific skills** that the worker should also have loaded so its `Skill(implement)` invocation lands in a context primed for the stack.

Recommend stack skills in `additions.swarm_worker_skills` — a flat list of skill names (no `from_template` indirection, no per-variant explosion). `/init-project` re-renders the worker with `SKILLS = ["scenario", "implement"] + swarm_worker_skills`.

Schema for the recommendation:

```json
"swarm_worker_skills": ["react-patterns", "react-testing-library", "accessibility"]
```

Rules:

- **Every skill listed must exist on disk** *or* appear earlier in `additions.skills[]` so it's installed before the worker re-render runs. `/init-project` enforces this; emit it correctly and the render lands cleanly.
- **Stack skills only.** Generic discipline (`code-structure`, `humanizer`) is already invoked by the worker's two mandatory skills (`scenario` → `code-structure`; `implement` → `code-structure` + `context7`). Don't duplicate.
- **Don't recommend new subagent types.** The worker's job is execution, not judgment; specialization happens via skills loaded into its context, not via parallel agent personas. New decision-making roles belong in skills, which run in main context where context richness matters.

## Output Guidelines

- **Recommend 1-2 of each type**: Don't overwhelm - surface the top 1-2 most valuable automations per category
- **If user asks for a specific type**: Focus only on that type and provide more options (3-5 recommendations)
- **Go beyond the reference lists**: The reference files contain common patterns, but use web search to find recommendations specific to the codebase's tools, frameworks, and libraries
- **Tell users they can ask for more**: End by noting they can request more recommendations for any specific category

## Automation Types Overview

| Type | Best For |
|------|----------|
| **Hooks** | Automatic actions on tool events (format on save, lint, block edits) |
| **Subagents** | Specialized reviewers/analyzers that run in parallel |
| **Skills** | Packaged expertise, workflows, and repeatable tasks (invoked by Claude or user via `/skill-name`) |
| **Plugins** | Collections of skills that can be installed |
| **MCP Servers** | External tool integrations (databases, APIs, browsers, docs) |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis

Gather project context:

```bash
# Detect project type and tools
ls -la package.json pyproject.toml Cargo.toml go.mod pom.xml 2>/dev/null
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | head -50

# Check dependencies for MCP server recommendations
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -E '"(react|vue|angular|next|express|fastapi|django|prisma|supabase|stripe)"'

# Check for existing Claude Code config
ls -la .claude/ CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null

# Analyze project structure
ls -la src/ app/ lib/ tests/ components/ pages/ api/ 2>/dev/null
```

**Key Indicators to Capture:**

| Category | What to Look For | Informs Recommendations For |
|----------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Language/Framework | package.json, pyproject.toml, import patterns | Hooks, MCP servers |
| Frontend stack | React, Vue, Angular, Next.js | Playwright MCP, frontend skills |
| Backend stack | Express, FastAPI, Django | API documentation tools |
| Database | Prisma, Supabase, raw SQL | Database MCP servers |
| External APIs | Stripe, OpenAI, AWS SDKs | context7 MCP for docs |
| Testing | Jest, pytest, Playwright configs | Testing hooks, subagents |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions, CircleCI | GitHub MCP server |
| Issue tracking | Linear, Jira references | Issue tracker MCP |
| Docs patterns | OpenAPI, JSDoc, docstrings | Documentation skills |

### Phase 2: Generate Recommendations

Based on analysis, generate recommendations across all categories:

#### A. MCP Server Recommendations

See [references/mcp-servers.md](references/mcp-servers.md) for detailed patterns.

| Codebase Signal | Recommended MCP Server |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Uses popular libraries (React, Express, etc.) | **context7** - Live documentation lookup |
| Frontend with UI testing needs | **Playwright** - Browser automation/testing |
| Uses Supabase | **Supabase MCP** - Direct database operations |
| PostgreSQL/MySQL database | **Database MCP** - Query and schema tools |
| GitHub repository | **GitHub MCP** - Issues, PRs, actions |
| Uses Linear for issues | **Linear MCP** - Issue management |
| AWS infrastructure | **AWS MCP** - Cloud resource management |
| Slack workspace | **Slack MCP** - Team notifications |
| Memory/context persistence | **Memory MCP** - Cross-session memory |
| Sentry error tracking | **Sentry MCP** - Error investigation |
| Docker containers | **Docker MCP** - Container management |

#### B. Skills Recommendations

See [references/skills-reference.md](references/skills-reference.md) for details.

Create skills in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Some are also available via plugins:

| Codebase Signal | Skill | Plugin |
|-----------------|-------|--------|
| Building plugins | skill-development | plugin-dev |
| Git commits | commit | commit-commands |
| React/Vue/Angular | frontend-design | frontend-design |
| Automation rules | writing-rules | hookify |
| Feature planning | feature-dev | feature-dev |

**Custom skills to create** (with templates, scripts, examples):

| Codebase Signal | Skill to Create | Invocation |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| API routes | **api-doc** (with OpenAPI template) | Both |
| Database project | **create-migration** (with validation script) | User-only |
| Test suite | **gen-test** (with example tests) | User-only |
| Component library | **new-component** (with templates) | User-only |
| PR workflow | **pr-check** (with checklist) | User-only |
| Releases | **release-notes** (with git context) | User-only |
| Code style | **project-conventions** | Claude-only |
| Onboarding | **setup-dev** (with prereq script) | User-only |

#### C. Hooks Recommendations

See [references/hooks-patterns.md](references/hooks-patterns.md) for configurations.

| Codebase Signal | Recommended Hook |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Prettier configured | PostToolUse: auto-format on edit |
| ESLint/Ruff configured | PostToolUse: auto-lint on edit |
| TypeScript project | PostToolUse: type-check on edit |
| Tests directory exists | PostToolUse: run related tests |
| `.env` files present | PreToolUse: block `.env` edits |
| Lock files present | PreToolUse: block lock file edits |
| Security-sensitive code | PreToolUse: require confirmation |

#### D. Subagent Recommendations

**Do not recommend new subagent types in this baseline.** The architecture commits to: decisions live in main context (where conversation history, screenshots, and offhand user feedback are preserved); subagents only execute pre-decided recipes (currently only `swarm-worker` for parallel code execution). Anything you'd previously have made a `code-reviewer` / `security-reviewer` / `api-documenter` subagent should be a **skill** invoked from main context — find or recommend a skill, not an agent.

If the project has a strong stack signal that warrants additional skills the `swarm-worker` should preload, recommend them via `additions.swarm_worker_skills` (described under "`swarm-worker` template — stack skills the worker should preload").

#### E. Plugin Recommendations

See [references/plugins-reference.md](references/plugins-reference.md) for available plugins.

| Codebase Signal | Recommended Plugin |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| General productivity | **anthropic-agent-skills** - Core skills bundle |
| Document workflows | Install docx, xlsx, pdf skills |
| Frontend development | **frontend-design** plugin |
| Building AI tools | **mcp-builder** for MCP development |

### Phase 3: Output Recommendations Report

Format recommendations clearly. **Only include 1-2 recommendations per category** - the most valuable ones for this specific codebase. Skip categories that aren't relevant.

```markdown
## Claude Code Automation Recommendations

I've analyzed your codebase and identified the top automations for each category. Here are my top 1-2 recommendations per type:

### Codebase Profile
- **Type**: [detected language/runtime]
- **Framework**: [detected framework]
- **Key Libraries**: [relevant libraries detected]

---

### 🔌 MCP Servers

#### context7
**Why**: [specific reason based on detected libraries]
**Install**: `claude mcp add context7`

#### [skill name]
**Why**: [specific reason]
**Create**: `.claude/skills/[name]/SKILL.md`
**Invocation**: User-only / Both / Claude-only
**Also available in**: [plugin-name] plugin (if applicable)
```yaml

**Want more?** Ask for additional recommendations for any specific category (e.g., "show me more MCP server options" or "what other hooks would help?").

**Want help implementing any of these?** Just ask and I can help you set up any of the recommendations above.
```

## Decision Framework

### When to Recommend MCP Servers
- External service integration needed (databases, APIs)
- Documentation lookup for libraries/SDKs
- Browser automation or testing
- Team tool integration (GitHub, Linear, Slack)
- Cloud infrastructure management

### When to Recommend Skills

- Document generation (docx, xlsx, pptx, pdf — also in plugins)
- Frequently repeated prompts or workflows
- Project-specific tasks with arguments
- Applying templates or scripts to tasks (skills can bundle supporting files)
- Quick actions invoked with `/skill-name`
- Workflows that should run in isolation (`context: fork`)

**Invocation control:**
- `disable-model-invocation: true` — User-only (for side effects: deploy, commit, send)
- `user-invocable: false` — Claude-only (for background knowledge)
- Default (omit both) — Both can invoke

### When to Recommend Hooks
- Repetitive post-edit actions (formatting, linting)
- Protection rules (block sensitive file edits)
- Validation checks (tests, type checks)

### When to Recommend Subagents
**Don't.** The baseline ships exactly one subagent (`swarm-worker`) for parallel code execution; "specialized expertise" is a skill-shaped problem in this architecture, not an agent-shaped one. Recommend the skill instead.

### When to Recommend Plugins
- Need multiple related skills
- Want pre-packaged automation bundles
- Team-wide standardization

---

## Configuration Tips

### MCP Server Setup

**Team sharing**: Check `.mcp.json` into repo so entire team gets same MCP servers

**Debugging**: Use `--mcp-debug` flag to identify configuration issues

**Prerequisites to recommend:**
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) - enables native GitHub operations
- Puppeteer/Playwright CLI - for browser MCP servers

### Headless Mode (for CI/Automation)

Recommend headless Claude for automated pipelines:

```bash
# Pre-commit hook example
claude -p "fix lint errors in src/" --allowedTools Edit,Write

# CI pipeline with structured output
claude -p "<prompt>" --output-format stream-json | your_command
```

### Permissions for Hooks

Configure allowed tools in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Edit", "Write", "Bash(npm test:*)", "Bash(git commit:*)"]
  }
}
```
