description: Write executable failing tests from a recipe handed to you by the main context. Used by `/tdd` Step 2 and ad-hoc when a phase needs tests-first to drive implementation. Decisions about which scenarios to cover, which categories matter, and which fixtures to use are made by the caller — this skill executes that recipe with code-structure discipline.
---

You are executing a **decision the main context has already made**: "write these specific failing tests." You do not invent scope, expand categories, or rewrite test conventions to your taste.

# Mandatory first step

Invoke `Skill(code-structure)` before writing any test file. Test files are code; the layer/abstraction rules apply.

# Inputs the caller must provide

If any are missing, **stop and ask** — do not infer. Inference is the failure mode.

- **Recipe**: an explicit list of scenarios to write. Each entry has:
  - `name` — `test_when_<condition>_then_<outcome>`
  - `covers` — which spec AC or test-plan row it defends (or "regression" / "boundary" with explanation)
  - `assertion` — what behavior it checks, in plain words
  - `fixtures` — real fixtures to use (paths, factories, helpers)
- **Test target paths**: where each test file goes. The caller resolves this from `project.json → tdd.test_globs` and the source under test.
- **Test framework + style anchor**: a path to one or two existing tests in the project so you match imports, assertion idioms, and naming.
- **Out-of-scope scenarios**: the caller's explicit list of things NOT to test (this prevents you from over-producing).

# Method

1. Read the style anchor tests in full. Match imports, assertion idioms, fixture wiring, naming.
2. Read `MEMORY.md` at `.claude/skill-memory/scenario/` if present — accumulated test conventions for this repo (fixture locations, framework quirks, helper idioms).
3. For each entry in the recipe, write a test that:
   - Uses the exact `name` the caller specified.
   - Asserts the behavior described in `assertion`. No softer, no broader.
   - Uses the `fixtures` provided. Real test DB, real filesystem temp dir. Mocks ONLY for: third-party HTTP APIs that can't run locally, system clock, OS randomness — each marked `# MOCK: <reason>`.
   - Is the smallest test that demonstrates the assertion. No setup theater.
4. Confirm each test fails for the right reason: run the test command on the new files and grep for the new test names. Capture which ones FAIL (good — they're red, ready for `implement`) vs which ones PASS or ERROR (bad — surface to caller).
5. After authoring, append any new convention you discovered to `.claude/skill-memory/scenario/MEMORY.md` (file path conventions, fixture idioms, framework quirks). Do not record per-task scenario content there.

# Output

Return inline:

```
# Scenarios — <slug or task id>

## Written
- <test_file_path>
  - <test_name> — covers <recipe.covers> — RED | PASS_UNEXPECTEDLY | ERROR

## Did NOT write
- <recipe entry skipped> — reason

## Open questions for the caller
- <a question that the recipe didn't answer and you couldn't safely guess>
```

# Constraints

- **You receive a recipe; you do not author scenario lists.** If the caller says "write tests for the auth flow" without listing scenarios, stop and ask for the recipe. Do not improvise.
- **Never write stub tests** (bodies that are `pass` or `assert true`).
- **Never write implementation code.** Tests only.
- **Never write a test file that won't be collectable.** If the source module doesn't exist yet, use `pytest.importorskip` / dynamic import / equivalent so the test loads and fails with a clear error.
- **Never modify other tests** to make yours pass.
- **Never approve specs or write to `docs/specs/`.**
- **Memory writes only to `.claude/skill-memory/scenario/`.** Test files go to project paths.
