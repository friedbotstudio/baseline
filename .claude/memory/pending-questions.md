# Pending questions

Questions the current session couldn't resolve. Surfaced at next session start so context isn't lost across yields.

Each entry's stable key is auto-numbered `Q-NNN`.

## Q-001

- Question: Should phase skills automatically invoke `/memory-flush` at start, or only when the SessionStart hook surfaces a "K candidates pending" nag?
- Raised in: 2026-04-27 memory-system build.
- Blocker for: clean session-start UX vs. interrupting flow.
- Options considered: (a) auto-invoke if pending count > 0; (b) nag only, let user decide; (c) auto-invoke with a "skip" command.

## Q-002

- Question: Should the spec phase require an enforceable runtime check (preflight, smoke, or error-mapping AC) for every one-time human prerequisite it identifies — instead of parking it in a Rollout-section bullet?
- Raised in: 2026-05-14 post-release. The release-workflow spec correctly identified "Pages source must be 'GitHub Actions'" in scout, research (Q-E), and spec rollout (line 553), but never wrote an AC for runtime detection. The prerequisite was missed at deploy time; failure surfaced as a misleading Jekyll build log on the repo root rather than a clear "Pages source wrong" message.
- Blocker for: deciding whether to amend the `spec` skill (or CLAUDE.md Article IV phase 4 rules) with a "silent-failure prerequisites require enforcement ACs" clause.
- Options considered:
  - (a) Amend spec skill: every Rollout prerequisite SHALL be paired with either a preflight AC or a smoke-test AC; no bare narrated prerequisites.
  - (b) Add a `spec-rollout-enforceability-review` skill (alongside diagram/traceability reviews) that scans Rollout sections and flags prerequisites without a matching AC.
  - (c) Leave it as judgment; document the heuristic in `conventions.md` instead of binding rule.
- Concrete remediation deferred: bootstrap script (`scripts/bootstrap-pages.mjs` calling `gh api -X PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pages -f build_type=workflow`) and/or a preflight step in `release.yml` that fails fast when `build_type != "workflow"`.
