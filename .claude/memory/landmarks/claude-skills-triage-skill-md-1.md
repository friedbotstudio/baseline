- Role: workflow entry point. Selects `entry_phase` (intake / spec / tdd / chore), writes `.claude/state/workflow.json`, seeds the `TaskCreate` checklist for every non-excepted phase + consent-gate placeholders (with `metadata.needs_user: true`). Auto-adds `swarm-plan`, `approve-swarm`, `swarm-dispatch`, `grant-commit`, `commit` to `exceptions` when the project is non-git.

- Caveat: the canonical task templates that the harness re-seeds from on every tick live inside this SKILL.md. Article V's "task discipline" rule depends on those templates being authoritative; if you change a phase's task shape, update the template here so harness re-seeding stays reconciled with `workflow.json → completed`.
