# Backlog

Future-work intent captured automatically by `memory_stop.sh`. Curated into this file via `/memory-flush`. Stable key shape: `<8-word-kebab>-<4-char-sha256>`. Entries use `superseded-at:` as the closure trigger (auto-delete on the next `/memory-flush` Step 0a sweep); the body `status:` field disambiguates whether the entry was `picked-up` (taken into a workflow) or `dropped` (decided not to do). Entries are decay-exempt: they do not stale-age regardless of `verified-at:` distance (see the stale-exempt carve-out in `memory_session_start.sh` and `sweep.py`).

## migrate-bash-python-heredocs-to-javascript-d454

> verbatim (user, 2026-05-17):
> this is a good point to remember that we want to move away from python and instead move to javascript for all these tasks.

- source: user-instruction
- status: open
- raised-on: 2026-05-17
- raised-in-context: backlog-memory-bucket
- estimated-effort: large
- verified-at: HEAD
- last-touched: 2026-05-17
- caveat: 18 bash-with-python-heredoc hooks plus standalone Python helpers (`sweep.py`, `resume_writer.py`, the `audit.sh` heredoc) need porting. The two JS-port pilots already landed (`git_commit_guard.mjs`, `consent_gate_grant.mjs`) provide the pattern — Node ESM helpers in `.claude/hooks/lib/common.mjs`, settings.json wiring on `.mjs` filenames. The `conventions.md → hook-script-shape` entry pins the current "python3 heredoc, no jq" contract; that convention flips with this migration. The user explicitly chose option B during the backlog-memory-bucket workflow: ship the backlog feature as-spec'd in Python, then queue the migration as a separate follow-on workflow with its own intake + scout + research + spec.
